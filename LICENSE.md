PLZ READ IF MAKING A MOD FOR THIS APP

This file is literally nothing but don't close yet remember,
if you make a mod since im using an mit lisence, i need ya'll
to add "Â©Copyright @Wildcat_Dev 2025" That's literally all i need just put
this at the bottom of the app, or on any warning screen, or even just in a license file
Like this, so anyway Happy modding! (Also, the Source code should be on this GitHub page
if not just right click the app and select edit and if you can't do that, then there
is a Source code file in the app folder, just open it. Also, if you do make a mod, then send it over
ofc I wanna try too. My email is Aroush.yt31@gmail.com, and if the file doesn't upload
Then email me, ur gonna send it over, then I will give ya'll other ways to contact me.)
